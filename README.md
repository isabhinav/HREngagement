# Gender and Workplace Experience
#### _Analytical Approach to Gaining Insights from Employee Engagement Data_

## Introduction
Employee engagement is a critical determinant of organizational success, influencing productivity, retention, and overall workplace satisfaction. However, engagement experiences and perceptions can significantly differ between demographic groups, especially between male and female employees.

In this project, we utilize exploratory data analysis techniques in R to uncover gender-based insights into employee engagement. By identifying differences in work experiences and perceptions between male and female employees, this analysis can guide strategic HR decisions to enhance satisfaction, foster inclusivity, and drive organizational success through targeted interventions and resource allocation.
